              <p><b>Introduction to Computer Engineering.</b> Binary arithmetic, Boolean algebra, logic and
memory elements, computer organization. We also worked with NAND NOR XOR AND OR NOT gates as well as did different Kmaps.</p>

              <p><b>Digital Systems Design</b> Microcontroller-based digital system design
                    methodology and techniques. Topics include basic machine organization, interface design, and C and assembly language programming for real-time embedded systems. We used C and Assembly to program our project. Our project had to take input from the user on a SIMON board and had do do adding and subtracting with the numbers. What we did to specialize our project is that we had a "Piano" we had a menu toggle button that would go between 4 options. 1st option was to just play the notes, second was to listen to 2 songs we had programed (Zelda Theme song, Mario), to record input and play it back at different timings and backwards, and to send input to an external lcd.</p>

              <p><b>Algorithms</b> In this class I learned about how different algorithms run in time and the theory about them. Also in this class we had to write papers and demonstrate our knowledge of the algorithms and theory but running programs to give us output of how long they each took in Polonomial time. We also learned about NP Hard NP Complete and NP problems. I used C++ to figure out all of the problems set that were given.</p>

              <p><b>File Structures And Introduction To
Database Systems</b> In this class I learned how to manage a database and how to connect a front end website to a back end database. I created a project with a team that had different design phases throuhoug the whole semester. The final project was a website written in HTML and C# that would look for classes that had previous test notes or homeworks and would return who taught them and which semester they were taught. I used C#, SQL, Visual Studio and HTML to do the project.</p>

              <p><b>Programming Languages And Translators</b> In this class we worked with MFPL and worked with Yacc and Bison to create a program that would detect errors and give good error messages for the first part of the semester. The second part of the semester we took to learn Lisp Prolog and Ruby, there was a lot of C++ in this class.</p>

              <p><b>Theory of Computer Science</b> I learned in this 
					course  the theoretical underpinnings of
					computer science. In particular, this coursewill
					cover the following topics: basic computability
					and formal language concepts, regular languages,
					context free languages, recursively-enumerable
					languages, and classes P, NP, and NPcompleteness. There was no programming languages used, but working with 2 tape machines and state machines was a common thing. </p>

              <p><b>Intro to Numerical Methods</b> in this class I learned finite difference interpolation, numerical
differentiation and integration, linear systems
ofequations, solution of nonlinear equations,
numerical solution of ordinary differential
equations, computational techniques and the
programming of a large number of problems on
digital computers. I used matlab and python in this class to help me work out the problems. </p>

              <p><b>Design Class</b> In this class I worked on a team to start a project from scratch. The project we had was to throw a ball as far as possible. our team decided to use a trebouche. We had alpha and beta testing and did paperwork throughout the whole entire project as well as gave a final presentation at the end. </p>
